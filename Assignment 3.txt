Ques: In CAT exam, Population S.D. is 100. A sample of 25 test taker has a mean of
520. COnstruct a 80% CONFIDENCE iNTERVAL.

Sol: Mean= 520, S.D= 100, n=25  alpha=1-0.80=0.20, z(0.1)=1.29
						  0.20

Lower fence= 520-1.29*(100/25^1/2)
		=545.8

Lower fence= 520+1.29*(100/25^1/2)
		=494.2

C.I [494.2, 545.8]
